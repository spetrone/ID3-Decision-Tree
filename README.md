# ID3-Decision-Tree 

Creator: Stephanie Petrone

1. Description
- This is a Java program that takes a dataset in csv format and builds a decision tree using the ID3 Algorithm.
- It uses entropy to calculate information gain. 
- The program will print the parsed dataset, the decision tree and the outcome of testing whether there is a solution.
- A solution is defined as all leaves having the same class. There is a stopping condition where leaves will take a majority class if all other attributes are the same and this would not be considered a solution.
